# SOEN-341-UB3

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Alex44711/SOEN-341-UB3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Alex44711/SOEN-341-UB3)

## Objective

Develop a questions and answers website for the project component of SOEN 341.

## Functionalities

This website will have several core features. 
One of them will be to be able to ask a question and answer other user's questions.
Another feature will be to vote, positively or negatively, on an answer that was given.
Finally, the last core feature will be to let the owner of a question accept an answer as
the best one or reject answers that do not help him at all.

To use these features, the user will have to have an account on our website and be logged in.
The only thing that the user can do while being logged off is to view the questions and answers of other users.

The extra feature that we decided to add is to have a user page. The user page will be an easy way for a frequent
user to find all the relevant information for him. On that user page, they will find all the questions they previously 
asked with all its information attached to it and all the answers they gave to other user's questions.
Another extra feature will be to have user-defined labels attached to questions and all users will be able to
sort through the bank of questions by those labels.

A search feature will also be available in the header to search through all the questions that were asked on the website.
